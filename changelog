	* Version 1.3.12

	* ofpath: Support for 2.6 kernels (2.6.3 or later required).

	* yaboot-howto: Add caveat regarding OSX UFS filesystems
	  (Thanks to Brian Sammon, and to Stefan Pfetzing for the German
	  translation).

	* ofpath: Bugfix to properly support IDE add-on cards.

2003-02-26  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.3.10

	* ofpath: Apple apparently can't decide whether its called `ata'
	  or `ide'; fix support for early iMac models.

2003-02-12  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.3.9

	* Mark first stage bootloader as compatible with new MacOS9
	  incompatible PowerMacs.

	* Really fix file search so IBM CHRP will work if there is more than
	  one type 0x83 partition.

2002-12-09  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.3.8

	* ofpath: Support new Xserve and Windtunnel PowerMacs.  
	  - NOTE: For this to fully work it requires a sufficiently recent
	    kernel.

	* Prefer $PATH_PREFIX/usr/sbin/ofpath if it exists.

	* yabootconfig: Add append="video=ofonly" if the running kernel
	  was booted with it, only if user does not specify --kernel-args.

2002-9-28  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.3.7

	* Documentation:
	  - Add German translation of yaboot-howto.
	  - Small updates to yaboot-howto.
	  - No longer tell people to send bugs to benh in yabootconfig(8).

	  the arch revision control system.

	* yaboot now includes two changelogs: "ChangeLog" which is a
	  detailed automatically generated list of changes, and "changelog"
	  (this file) which is a hand written understandable summary of
	  changes between releases.

2001-12-01  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.3.6

	* The "IBM needs to test prereleases" release.

	* Documentation:
	  - New IGNORE^H^H^H^H^H^HREADME, thanks to Chris Tillman for
	    cleaning up the pile of cruft that this thing was.
	  - yabootconfig man page was missing --kernel-args from SYNOPSIS.
	  - Include README.rs6000 in the binary dist.

	* ybin:
	  - Automatically use fstype=raw on IBM CHRP, it no longer needs
	    to be explicitly set in /etc/yaboot.conf.
	  - Deprecate ybin's yaboot.conf auto-generation, use yabootconfig
	    instead.

	* yaboot:
	  - Fix IBM CHRP support.
	  - Fix device path parsing to support devices containing a comma,
	    but not including a filename.
	  - Add support for zImage.initrd (Peter Bergner).
	  - help output no longer claims device=NULL if yaboot.conf does not define it.
	  - Make password prompting a bit nicer looking.

2001-10-28  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.3.5

	* Add yaboot-howto, Thanks to Chris Tillman.

	* yaboot:
	  - XFS fixes for large partitions (Brendan O'Dea).
	  - Upgrade libext2fs to 1.25, this adds full ext3 support to yaboot.
	  - Reiserfs fixes (Jeff Mahoney).
	  - Implement the message= configuration option (see yaboot.conf man page).

2001-10-13  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.3.4

	* ybin: Correct a verbosity message.

	* yaboot:
	  - Add SGI XFS filesystem support.
	  - Rewrite OpenFirmware device path parsing code.  This fixes
	    many bugs and inconsistencies in yaboot's file loading.
	  - Fix OpenFirmware filesystem support to automatically convert
	    path separator from / to \.  CDROM authors no longer need to use
	    kludges like image=\\install\\powermac\\vmlinux.
	  - Fix kernel loading on some systems.
	  - Allow for getting files from tftp server that does not run a
	    bootpd/dhcpd.
	  - Fix netboot when using the `n' key.
	  - Fix a great deal of incorrect format strings which could cause
	    yaboot crashes.
	  - Fix all filesystems to properly return error conditions, and
	    report those error conditions (instead of just saying `image not
	    found').
	  - Make configuration file open error consistent with other file
	    open errors.
	  - Add `help' command to yaboot which prints out basic usage information.
	  - Add non-fatal warning when bootstrap partition has wrong type (pmac only).
	  - Minor code rearrangement.
	  - General cruft removal and code cleanup.

	* Makefile cleanup, make filesystems configurable.
	
2001-09-25  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.3.3

	* Add --debug option to yabootconfig

	* Fix BSD booting support somewhat.  The bsd= option's semantics
	  have changed, it must now be set to the BSD root partition.  ybin
	  will now install /usr/local/lib/yaboot/ofwboot onto the bootstrap
	  partition when bsd= is present in /etc/yaboot.conf.  The dual boot
	  menu will then execute "ofwboot <bsd_root_part>,/bsd" this means
	  the bsd kernel must be at /bsd on the BSD root partition.

2001-09-24  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.3.2

	* Fix Makefile thinko where make install failed if
	  /etc/yaboot.conf already existed.

2001-09-20  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.3.1

	* Don't include /etc/yaboot.conf in binary dist, instead put the
	  example in /usr/local/share/doc.  This way extracting the tarball
	  from / won't blow away existing configs.

	* Move strip commands from install target to strip target, install
	  now depends on strip.

2001-09-20  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.3

	* Merging of ybin and yaboot source trees, this is now the
	  official upstream yaboot/ybin source tree.

	* yaboot:
	  - Various ppc64 & chrp fixes by Peter Bergner, fix fdisk partition
	    handling.
	  - Fix netboot (was broken by reiserfs patch)
	
2001-08-26  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.2.6

	* ofpath became broken on non-scsi systems due to quoting fix.
	
2001-08-20  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.2.5

	* Fix broken quoting uncovered by debian's current /bin/ash.

2001-08-06  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.2.4

	* ofboot: remove <OS-VOLUME-NAME> tag as it was causing the
	  OpenFirmware multibooter to crash.

	* mkofboot: zero first 800K of bootstrap partition before creating
	  filesystem.

	* yaboot:
	  - Version 1.2.3
	  - Supports using an md5 hash as well as plaintext password. (me)
	  - Fix again system.map loading. That also fix an old pending bug
	    we had where yaboot could pass random values for system.map,
	    causing the kernel to mark random pages reserved. (BenH)
	  - IBM CHRP fixes. (Peter Bergner)
	  - Add reiserfs support (Jeff Mahoney)

2001-06-30  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.2.3

	* ofpath:
	  - Version 1.0
	  - Add support for IBM CHRP, thanks to Marco d'Itri for testing.
	  - Use real wc if available, this speeds up ofpath slightly for scsi.
	  - Make variables local to their function unless they need to be global.

	* ybin:
	  - If installing on IBM CHRP run addnote on yaboot binary before installing.
	  - Reword some error/verbose messages
	  - Make variables local to their function unless they need to be global.

2001-06-24  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.2.2

	* yabootconfig:
	  - Now works with braindamaged versions of pdisk.
	  - Add --kernel-args switch which allows boot-floppies to easily
	    add an append= line if needed.

2001-06-01  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.2.1

	* Fix test for strict posix/SUS echo behavior.

	* Check for printf built into the shell.

	* yabootconfig: check for and attempt to deal with cross device symlinks.

2001-05-28  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.2

	* Added yabootconfig, a script to build a valid /etc/yaboot.conf

	* ybin:
	  - Detect IBM CHRP hardware and disable nvram update automatically
	  - Automatically run yabootconfig if /etc/yaboot.conf is missing
	  - Check for PATH_PREFIX environment variable and add all bin and
	    sbin directories from under it to PATH.  This is for boot-floppies.
	  - Add bsd= to list of multiboot options.

	* ofboot: bump maximum number of OSes to 8.

	* ofpath:
	  - No longer report bogus paths for non-existent scsi devices.
	  - Fix bug where garbage characters were mixed with the
	    OpenFirmware device path.
	  - Fix broken Wallstreet PowerBook support.
	  - Add support for silly devfs naming convention, Thanks to Tom Rini.

2001-05-06  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.1.1

	* ofboot: 
	  - Hopefully fix random and rare booting problem when chainloading
	    other OSes.  Thanks to Segher Boessenkool for the fix.
	  - Add volume name which shows up in the OpenFirmware multiboot
	    screen.
	  - It is now possible to replace the badge icon for the multiboot
	    screen, see examples/README.mbicon.

	* yaboot: 
	  - Version 1.2.1
	  - Includes my previous 1.1.1-eb3 patches for password protection and single-key.

	* Various spelling errors and clarifications to man pages.  Thanks to sword.

2001-04-26  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.1

	* ofpath:
	  - Version 0.8
	  - Add support for Performa 6400_200, PowerMac 4400, and the clones.
	  - Removed `No such file or directory' errors when system has no
	    scsi at all.

	* ybin:  
	  - If delay= is not set use value of timeout= (converted to
	    seconds) instead.
	  - Removed command line options --type, --creator, and long
	    obsolete and deprecated --conffile.  The config file options
	    hfstype and hfscreator are still there.
	  - Removed long obsolete and deprecated bootconf= config option.
	  - Removed some old now unneeded debug cruft.

	* yaboot:
	  - Include version 1.1.1-eb3, this includes the following changes
	  - Adds password protection capabilities.
	  - Add `single-key' option from silo.

	* Documentation:
	  - Rewrote the yaboot.conf man page, now derived from silo.conf(5)

2001-03-22  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 1.0

	* ybin:
	  - Fix a few bugs that occured when magicboot= was not used.  
	  - Add basic support for IBM style bootstrap partitions.  These
	    partitions have yaboot dded directly to them.  See the yaboot.conf
	    man page regarding fstype for more info, also
	    examples/yaboot.conf.rs6k. 
	  - Don't require that ofpath be installed if its not needed.

	* Documentation:
	  - Added examples/yaboot.conf.rs6k
	  - Man page updates for IBM support.

2001-02-19  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.31

	* ofpath:
	  - Quiet shell error when run on non-PowerMac (but still
	    PowerPC) hardware.
	  - Properly recognize more OldWorld PowerMac G3s. 
	  - Fix OldWorld detection for kernels < 2.2.17
	  - Require that /proc be mounted.

	* ybin: 
	  - Fix OldWorld detection for kernels < 2.2.17
	  - Make the `not bootable on OldWorld' warning very loud and
	    obnoxious. 	
	  - Change PATH to make /usr/local the last component instead of
	    the first.
	  - Make the text/background color in the boot menu configurable,
	    see the yaboot.conf(5) man page for details. 
	  - Change default foreground color to white per yaboot 1.0.
	  - Remove support for obsolete /etc/ybin.conf.

	* Documentation: 
	  - Clarified the `partition=' variable in the yaboot.conf man page
	    and correct an error in the example in that man page.
	  - Added more comments to included yaboot.conf examples. 

	* yaboot: 
	  - Include version 1.1.1
	  - Includes color support

2000-11-18  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.30

	* ybin: add `brokenosx' option, when used with macosx= ybin makes
	the MacOSX menu entry execute \System\Library\CoreServices\BootX
	directly instead of using \\:tbxi.  This is necessary for
	people who insist on installing OSX on HFS+ instead of UFS, since
	MacOS deblesses HFS+ OSX partitions.
	
2000-10-28  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.29 (the brown paper bag release)

	* The yaboot.conf man page was broken.

	* While were at it, include yaboot 0.9 binary (compiled -Os,
	stripped)
	
2000-10-24  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.28

	* ybin: Add mntpoint= option, this allows ybin to install the
	bootstrap into an already mounted filesystem.  This is NOT
	recommended unless you know what your doing.  

	* ybin: fixed generation of ofboot.b so it will work with nobless
	and usemount.
	
2000-10-20  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.27

	* ofboot: fixed problem where text was not visible on some newer iMacs. 

	* ybin: Now warn the user when they are using ybin on an OldWorld
	PowerMac.  (it will still work since its possible to make newworld
	bootable disks on an OldWorld mac)

	* ofpath: Now works on oldworld macs under 2.4 kernels. 

	* Added check for packaged versions of ybin to the Makefile and
	warn user about them.
	
2000-09-23  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.26

	* ofboot: completely rewrote the generator script, it is now more
	extendable and supports more menu options.  More thanks to iNOUE
	Koich! for the continuing help on OpenFirmware issues!!

	* ybin: added options for mulitboot menu: now can create a menu
	with options for GNU/Linux, MacOS, MacOSX, Darwin, and booting off
	a CDROM, from the network, and even directly into an OpenFirmware
	prompt. 

	* ybin: some errors were sent to stdout instead of stderr, fixed.

	* ofpath: refuse to run on anything but GNU/Linux.  (for now anyway)
	
2000-09-18  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.25

	* ofboot: now changes the background color to black and the text
	color to cyan like yaboot.  Thanks to again to iNOUE Koich!  

2000-09-16  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.24

	* ofboot: many bugs in the Forth code fixed. code should now be
	compliant to the OpenFirmware spec.  Also add CD boot menu option.
	(add enablecdboot to /etc/yaboot.conf) Thanks to iNOUE Koich! for
	the Forth code.

2000-09-13  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.23

	* ybin: now hard code the target filename for ofboot, its always
	installed as ofboot.b on the bootstrap partition.  This eliminates
	ambiguity when someone tries a different script with different name.

	* ybin: all debugging output goes to stderr now.

2000-09-09  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.22

	* ofboot.b renamed to ofboot.  (.b means boot block which this is not) 

	* yaboot and ofboot are now installed in /usr/local/lib/yaboot/
	instead of /boot, since these files are never directly accessed by
	the firmware it is not really appropriate to keep them in /boot.
	make install will create backwords compatibility symlinks when
	installing over an older version of ybin so nothing should break.
	IMPORTANT: you should run mkofboot on a dedicated bootstrap
	partition to purge old filenames.

	* Man pages updated to reflect new file locations.  Also include a
	patch to change the paths to /usr/lib/yaboot for Debian and redhat
	package maintainers.

	* ybin: now checks two places for a default value for install=
	/usr/local/lib/yaboot/yaboot, /usr/lib/yaboot/yaboot.
	
2000-09-02  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.21

	* ybin: fixed nvram update so it uses a real filename instead of
	\\:tbxi when nobless is set in /etc/yaboot.conf.  (\\: means find
	file in blessed directory).

	* ofpath: more oldworld machines supported.  Now supports 7200,
	7300, 8600, 9500, Gossamer G3, PowerBook 1998, PowerBook 3400 (and
	possibly 2400).
	
2000-08-31  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.20

	* ybin: check for Newworld compatible nvsetenv and if found will
	automatically update the OpenFirmware boot-device variable in
	nvram.

	* ofpath: support some oldworld machines. (this does not mean
	ybin/yaboot supports oldworld).  Also silence a harmless error on
	machines lacking a CDROM.

	* ofboot.b: added more machines to <COMPATIBLE>
	
2000-08-25  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.19

	* Added PowerMac3,2 and PowerMac3,3 to ofboot.b scripts.  Fixes
	Debian bug #69870

2000-08-22  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.18

	* ofboot.b: changed the yaboot boot commands to boot yaboot by
	filename rather then file type. Booting by file type did not work
	reliably on all machines.

	* ybin: hard code the target filename for yaboot, regardless of
	the source filename (from install=) the target filename on the
	bootstrap partition will always be "yaboot.b".

	* Added ofpath utility, this is a rewrite of the show_of_path.sh
	utility written by Olaf Hering.  Ofpath works with /bin/ash and on
	stripped down systems such as the Debian boot floppies.  Also
	wrote a small man page for this utility.

	* ybin: automatically use ofpath to find the OpenFirmware device
	path when ofpath= is not defined in /etc/yaboot.conf.  Ybin will
	also use ofpath when macos= or macosx= are set to unix device
	nodes (ie /dev/hda11), these options can still be set to
	OpenFirmware paths as well. 

	* Makefile: minor cleanup, added installation of ofpath
	utility/man page as well as a deinstall rule.

2000-08-13  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.17

	* Yaboot 0.7 binary included.

	* ybin: fix bug where ybin would fail if the bootstrap files
	included an "_" in the filename.  (actually its a workaround for
	hfsutils brain-damage)

	* ofboot.b: completely rewritten.  Now includes shell script code
	to allow ybin to configure it based on config options in
	/etc/yaboot.conf instead of requiring the user to edit it
	themselves.  Additionally this new script will display a REAL boot
	menu when dual booting is configured.  It is capable of dual or
	tri booting GNU/Linux (yaboot), MacOS 8.*/9.* and MacOSX.  This
	new ofboot.b script should *NOT* be edited by the user, and thus
	should NOT be marked as a conffile in Debian and redhat packages.
	These packages should now install ofboot.b in /boot instead of
	/etc since it is no longer a config file.  WARNING: The Forth code
	in this script has not been tested on all machines and may not be
	universally compatible.  Thanks to Chris Emerson for writing the
	Forth code.

	* yaboot.conf: new options: ofboot= macos= macosx= delay=
	defaultos=.  See the yaboot.conf man page for details. 

	* Now include a Makefile to handle installation, only make install
	is defined.  Removed install-sh. 

	* mkofboot is now distributed and installed as a symlink instead
	of a hardlink.
	
	* Man page updates.
	
2000-04-25  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.16

	* menu_ofboot.b: fixed bug where the yaboot line was missing the
	boot command, this prevented it from booting yaboot.

2000-04-25  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.15

	* Merge quik's bootstrap(8) man page with ybin's ofboot(8) man
	page and rename it back to bootstrap(8).  This also solves the
	conflict with quik.  In a more useful way IMO.

2000-04-24  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.14

	* Ship man pages uncompressed, gzip them in install-sh instead,
	this allows for easier patching by debian maintainers if need be.

	* Rename bootstrap(8) man page to ofboot(8) so ybin does not
	conflict with quik.
	
2000-04-23  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.13

	* Rewrote the config file parsing yet again to remove dependencies
	on tr, and awk.  This allows ybin to function on minimal systems
	such as boot/rescue floppies.  This also pretty much solves the
	slowness problem.  Thanks to Daniel Jacobwitz for the help.

	* Made changes to remove dependencies on basename and wc.  Again
	this is to allow ybin to work on boot floppies.

	* Changed all calls to grep to stop using GNU extensions, this is
	so ybin will work properly with the minimal version of grep
	included in busybox.

	* Added signal handling so ybin/mkofboot will cleanup after
	themselves if killed with signals 1 2 3 or 15.
	
	* Added OS Badge icons to the ofboot.b scripts.  On G4 machines
	you can hold down the option key and get a graphical boot selector
	with one button for each bootable partition, the button with the
	penguin icon is the bootstrap partition.  Thanks to Nicholas
	Humfrey for creating the Badge icon.

	* Minor updates to the man pages.
	
2000-04-19  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.12

	* Now include yaboot binary in ybin distribution.

	* Include a install-sh script to install everything.

	* Use of the separate ybin.conf file is deprecated.  Use
	/etc/yaboot.conf instead.

	* Removed the so called kludge options, without being able to
	bless the root directory they were just useless bloat.

	* Removed useless --readonly option, it was already default (as it
	should be)

	* Deprecated bootconf options since the yaboot.conf is the same
	config ybin uses.  (it is still there and works but that may change)

	* Changed configuration file format to be more like quik/lilo:
	bootfile= is now install= (--bootfile is now --install), wrapper=
	is now magicboot=, usemount, protect, and hide are now just a
	keyword options, if they are present in the configuration file
	they are turned on, if they are not present they are turned off.
	bless= is now the nobless keyword option, since bless is default
	this one changed names.

	* ybin: no longer need to specify -C /dev/null if you don't have a
	configuration file in /etc/.  If this is the case ybin will generate
	a generic yaboot.conf to install on the bootstrap partition.  

	* More changes to the configuration parsing to improve speed, the
	format change also helped the speed problem.

	* Added man pages for ybin, mkofboot, yaboot, yaboot.conf and
	bootstrap. 

	* More general fixes/cleanup/tweaks.
	
2000-03-13  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.11

	* Added command line options to both scripts, try --help. This
	makes the ybin.conf file optional if you wish (-C /dev/null)

	* Changed the way the config file is parsed, no longer source it
	with the shell, this allows ybin.conf to be merged with
	yaboot.conf at which point yaboot can live with unknown options in
	its config file. 

	* Use /etc/ybin.conf if it exists, if not use /etc/yaboot.conf for
	ybin configuration.

	* Merged ybin and mkofboot into one script, mkofboot shared 90% of
	of its code with ybin anyway and this will make them much easier
	to maintain. mkofboot is now a hard link to ybin (or a symlink if
	you prefer, both will work)

	* Added an experimental feature to generate a yaboot.conf on the
	fly based on command line options.  The defaults should be
	workable on a Debian system with an internal ATA disk, with the
	root partition being the 3rd on the disk. Depends on mktemp for
	creating the temporary file, Debian's mktemp is secure against
	race conditions, use with caution if your distribution lacks a
	secure mktemp utility. This option is activated with -c auto.

	* No longer depends on bash. Works with Debian's
	/bin/ash. Interpreter is now set to /bin/sh.

	* Assorted cleanup, minor bug fixes.

	* Added example yaboot.conf.
	
2000-02-04  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.10

	* Added a simple multi-boot menu written by Benjamin Herrenschmidt.

2000-01-17  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.9

	* mkofboot was still broken. :-(


2000-01-14  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.8

	* Added a basic CHRP script ofboot.b to work around the problem of
	OF refusing to load `tbxi' files unless they contain a CHRP boot
	header. See README.ofboot.b for details.

	* Updated default ybin.conf to install ofboot.b by default.
	
2000-01-13  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.7

	* mkofboot: Check for hformat was broken. 

2000-01-12  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.6

	* mkofboot: Fixed problem where it was insisting that mkdosfs be
	present even when using hfs filesystems if usemount=yes.

	* mkofboot: Added proper checks for hformat or mkdosfs.
	
2000-01-09  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.5

	* First public release.
	
	* Add TODO and BUGS files.

	* mkofboot: Check to see if usemount=yes, and if so make sure we
	are root before proceeding to erase the partition.

	* ybin: Removed useless echo line. 
	
2000-01-05  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.4

	* ybin (util_install): Fully support OF `wrappers' now: if a
	wrapper is defined in the configuration file then the wrapper is
	given the HFS file type specified instead of the bootfile, the
	bootfile's type is set to "boot".  

	* ybin: New configuration option `bless' when yes and are using
	hfsutils we will `bless' the root directory of the bootstrap
	filesystem so OF should be able to find and boot the system
	without reconfiguration.

	* mkofboot/ybin (checkconf): Add validation for the new `bless'
	option. Also add check that the wrapper, if defined, exists and we
	have permission to it.
	
2000-01-04  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.3.
	
	* ybin (util_install): Quote the filetype/creator arguments to
	hattrib to prevent the shell from interpreting any meta-characters
	in some cases. Also no longer try and set metadata on wrapper if
	there is no wrapper.

	* mkofboot: When creating hfs or dos filesystems give them volume
	label of "bootstrap".
	
2000-01-03  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.2.

	* mkofboot: added -w switch to grep when checking if a filesystem
	is already mounted to prevent erroneous positive matches.

	* ybin (util_install): Add check to make sure that the target
	device is not mounted as a filesystem before mucking with it.

	* Added changelog.
	
2000-01-01  Ethan Benson  <erbenson@alaska.net>

	* Version 0.1.
	
	* first version.
