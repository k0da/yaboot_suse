--------------------------------------------

Yaboot is an OpenFirmware bootloader for Open Firmware based
machines. It is known to work on "NewWorld" class powermacs
(iMac and all machines released after it), RS/6000, and possibly
other OF based CHRP machines.
"OldWorld" PowerMacs (with the old MacOS ROM buit-in) are not
supported.
