The fastest way to install ybin and yaboot is to run `make install'.

This will install the man pages in /usr/local/man by default and
ybin/mkofboot in /usr/local/sbin.  yaboot and ofboot will be
installed in /usr/local/lib/yaboot/.

you may change the install paths by setting variables ROOT, PREFIX and
MANDIR to make.  ie make ROOT=/ PREFIX=/usr MANDIR=/share/man (this is only
intended for package maintainers.)

yaboot can be installed where you like but
/usr/local/lib/yaboot/yaboot is the first default location ybin will
look, followed by /usr/lib/yaboot/yaboot.

ybin needs hfsutils version 3.2.6 or later.

The man pages should be installed in /usr/local/man/man?/.  The *.8.gz
pages should be in /usr/local/man/man8/ and the *.5.gz page should be
in /usr/local/man/man5/.

If you need to remove ybin (say if your installing a debian package or
.rpm) you can do so by issuing the command `make deinstall'.
