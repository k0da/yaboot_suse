* Add nvram updating support for IBM hardware.  This requires ofpath
   to support these machines.  It also requires a compatible nvsetenv
   or equivilent. 

* Validate yaboot options before proceeding. (need better config parsing)

* Password protection for insecure menu options (MacOS).

* Use system libext2fs instead of shipping a private copy (this is not
  as simple as it sounds)

* Figure out all the crap with CHRP netbooting, probably have to remove
  hard-coding of ":0" after a net devuce path (done as of 1.3.4?)

* Support for compressed images
