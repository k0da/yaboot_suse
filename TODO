* Interactive shell mode for yaboot, similar to the grub shell.

* Add nvram updating support for IBM hardware.  This requires ofpath
  to support these machines (ofpath done, or mostly so).  It also
  requires a compatible nvsetenv or equivilent. 

* Validate yaboot options before proceeding. (need better config parsing)

* Password protection for insecure menu options (MacOS).

* Use system libext2fs instead of shipping a private copy (this is not
  as simple as it sounds)

* Figure out all the crap with CHRP netbooting, probably have to remove
  hard-coding of ":0" after a net device path (done as of 1.3.4?)

* JFS support.

* Support for compressed images (this will probably be solved in the kernel)
